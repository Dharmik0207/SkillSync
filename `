SkillSync 🚀

AI Skill Gap Analyzer & Learning Roadmap Generator

SkillSync is a small project I built to explore how multi-agent AI systems can help with career planning.

The idea came from a simple problem:
When we aim for a new job role, it’s hard to clearly know what skills we’re missing and what to learn next. SkillSync acts like a mini AI career assistant that helps answer those questions.

It analyzes your current skills, compares them with a target role, and generates a step-by-step learning roadmap.

Why I Built This

Many students and professionals:

Don’t know which skills matter most for a role

Feel overwhelmed by what to learn next

Spend hours researching learning paths

I wanted to experiment with CrewAI multi-agent systems and build something practical that solves this problem automatically.

What SkillSync Does

SkillSync simulates a small team of AI agents working together:

• One agent understands your current skills
• One agent studies the job role requirements
• One agent finds the skill gap
• One agent creates a learning roadmap

Together, they generate a structured plan to help you move toward your target role.

How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

The project uses CrewAI, which allows multiple AI agents to collaborate and complete tasks step by step.

Each agent has a specific responsibility:

Skill Analyst
Takes your current skills and organizes them into structured categories.

Job Analyst
Understands the requirements of the role you want.

Gap Detector
Compares both and finds what’s missing.

Roadmap Generator
Creates a prioritized learning path based on the gaps.

This workflow shows how multi-agent AI can solve real-world problems.

# SkillSync – AI Skill Matching & Career Recommendation System

This project started as an idea: *What if resume screening and job matching could be automated using AI agents working together?*  
SkillSync is my attempt to explore how multi-agent LLM systems can help match people with the right roles and suggest how they can improve their skills.

## 📌 About the Project
Recruiters spend a lot of time manually reviewing resumes and comparing them with job descriptions.  
With SkillSync, I built a small AI workflow that simulates an intelligent hiring assistant.

The system can:
- Read and understand a candidate’s skills
- Analyze job requirements
- Compare both and estimate job fit
- Suggest missing skills and career improvements

This project helped me learn how **multi-agent AI systems** can automate real HR workflows.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- CrewAI (multi-agent orchestration)  
- LLM integration  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 How It Works
The project uses multiple AI agents that collaborate:

1. A **Skill Extraction Agent** identifies key skills from the input.
2. A **Job Analysis Agent** understands job requirements.
3. A **Matching Agent** compares both and calculates job fit.
4. A **Recommendation Agent** suggests missing skills and career paths.
